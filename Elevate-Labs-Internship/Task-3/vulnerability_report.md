## 2. Detailed Findings

###  Medium Severity
#### **1. DCE/RPC & MSRPC Services Enumeration (Port 135)**
- **Risk:** Allows attackers to enumerate Windows RPC services.
- **Exposed Services:** `lsass`, `spoolsv`, Event Logging, and more.
- **Impact:** Enables attackers to gather system details for further exploitation (e.g., privilege escalation).
- **Fix:**
  - Block **port 135** on external networks.
  - Restrict access to trusted LAN/VPN hosts only.
  - Disable unused RPC services.
  - Keep Windows system fully patched.

---

###  Low Severity
#### **2. ICMP Timestamp Reply Enabled**
- **Risk:** Reveals system time-based information.
- **Impact:** Attackers can estimate OS uptime or perform fingerprinting.
- **Fix:**
  - Disable ICMP timestamp replies.
  - Block ICMP Type 13/14 at the firewall.

---

###  Low Severity
#### **3. TCP Timestamp Information Disclosure**
- **Risk:** Allows uptime estimation and aids in reconnaissance.
- **Fix:**
  - Disable TCP timestamps if not required.
    - **Linux:** `net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0`
    - **Windows:** `netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled`

---

## 3. Priority-Based Documentation

###  **Highest Priority: Port 135 DCE/RPC Enumeration**
- **Reason:** Common entry point for Windows attacks.
- **Action:** Restrict using firewall rules and verify required RPC services.

###  Low-Level Recon Issues
- ICMP Timestamp  
- TCP Timestamp  
These are low impact but support attacker reconnaissance.

---

## 4. Recommendations
- Harden firewall rules.
- Disable unnecessary services.
- Restrict RPC to trusted hosts.
- Disable ICMP and TCP timestamp responses.
- Patch and update the OS.
- Perform a follow-up scan after remediation.
