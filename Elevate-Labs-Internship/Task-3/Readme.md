# Vulnerability Assessment – Task 3

This repository contains the work I completed for **Task 3: Vulnerability Assessment**.

## What I Did

1. **Used the OpenVAS (Greenbone Community Edition) free online scanner** to scan **my own system**.
2. Generated the official scan report and exported it as a **PDF (Task-3-Report.pdf)**.
3. Captured screenshots of:
   - The **OpenVAS dashboard**
   - The **detected vulnerabilities**
4. Saved all screenshots inside the **`screenshots/` folder**.
5. Uploaded the PDF report and screenshots to this repository.
