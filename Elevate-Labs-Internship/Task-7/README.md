# README: Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions

This guide explains how to review, identify, and remove potentially malicious or unnecessary browser extensions. It also outlines how harmful extensions can affect users and provides documentation steps for auditing.

## 1. Open the Browser’s Extension/Add-ons Manager

Access your browser’s extension management page:

- **Google Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/`
- **Microsoft Edge:** `edge://extensions/`
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Menu → **Add-ons and Themes**
- **Safari (macOS):** Safari → **Settings** → **Extensions**

## 2. Review All Installed Extensions

Check the full list of installed extensions. Look for any that appear:

- Unrecognized
- Unnecessary
- Recently installed without your awareness

## 3. Check Permissions and Reviews

### Permissions
Look for excessive access, such as:

- Read/modify data on all websites
- Access to browser history
- Managing downloads
- Reading clipboard data

### Reviews
Search for user feedback mentioning:

- Ads or pop-ups
- Redirects
- Privacy concerns
- Suspicious behavior

## 4. Identify Unused or Suspicious Extensions

Flag extensions that are:

- No longer needed
- Poorly rated
- From unknown developers
- Causing unusual browser behavior (slowness, pop-ups, redirects)

## 5. Remove Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions

Uninstall any extension that looks suspicious or isn’t needed.

If removal is difficult:

- Disable the extension first
- Restart the browser
- Attempt removal again

(If the extension still can’t be removed, run a malware scan.)

## 6. Restart the Browser & Check for Improvements

After removal:

- Restart your browser
- Test for better performance
- Confirm issues like ads or redirects have stopped

## 7. How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

Malicious browser extensions may:

- Track browsing activity
- Steal personal or sensitive data
- Inject ads, pop-ups, or redirects
- Hijack search engines or homepages
- Slow down browser performance
- Install additional malware
- Capture keystrokes (in severe cases)

## 8. Document Actions Taken

Record the following for audit or troubleshooting purposes:

- Extensions identified as suspicious
- Extensions removed
- Risky permissions encountered
- Browser reset or cleanup steps performed
- Improvements or behavioral changes afterward
